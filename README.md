Medical Diagnosis System
A machine learning-powered web app predicting diseases from user-selected symptoms. Ensemble of Random Forest and XGBoost ensures robust and accurate predictions, even for rare conditions (using class weighting to handle imbalanced data). The app highlights feature importance for transparency.

Users input symptoms; the app displays predicted diseases and top contributing symptoms.

Team roles: Machine learning R&D (ensemble, class weighting), UI/UX, and deployment.
